Requires Flux Library 3.4.0 - [Download here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fl/files)

### Updates to Online Market
Online Market just became more useful.

- Any item registered in `flux:market_accept` item tag can be used as an alternative for default items.
- Alternative item must have matching item tags before it can be accepted in a trade.
- Selecting trades won't pass alternative items.
- Currently, only ingots are allowed by default. This satisfies Flux ingots trades with Flux Engineer.

### Other changes
- Russian translation (by EleC0TroN)
- Fixed negative work speed (no progress seen) caused by adding a catalyst in Flux Generator.

You can add your own native language to Flux.
